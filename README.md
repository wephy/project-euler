# Project Euler Solutions [project-euler]

**Project Euler solutions. I attempt to find the perfect balance between making extremely efficient/optimised code, 'code-golfing', and also having the solution be understandable/intuitive.**

Currently, most of problems have only python solutions—I aim to eventually offer solutions in the majority of the popular scripting languages.

Also, in accordance with Project Euler's request, problems beyond 100 will not be visible publically—encoded with the problems' answer as the key.
