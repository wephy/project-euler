# Project Euler Solutions [project-euler]

**Project Euler solutions. I attempt to find the perfect balance between making extremely efficient/optimised code, 'code-golfing', and also having the solution be understandable/intuitive.**

Currently, the majority of problems have only python solutions.

Also, in accordance with Project Euler's request, problems beyond 100 will not be visible publically---encoded with the problems' answer as the key.
